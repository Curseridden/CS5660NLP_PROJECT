# CS5660NLP_PROJECT

**Instruction**

The following Python Libraries are required for running the project:

**discord.api**

**openai**

**python-dotenv**

**requests**

Upon installing all the libraries, go under **\CS5660Bot** and create a **.env** including two variables:

**OPENAI_API_TOKEN=**

**DISCORD_TOKEN=**

Lastly, run **python run.py** to start the program, and your own discord bot should be launched and is waiting for your input.

If you have not created a discord bot, follow the instruction on [ChatGPT Tutorial - Create a Chatbot for Discord with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdgVv4UP08c) from 1:24 to 3:58
